Bogus Sass Checker
==================

This is a little ruby script that checks your rails project's Sass files for #ids and .classes and checks if you are using them in the rest of your rails project.
ack needs to be installed first ( http://betterthangrep.com/ )

Installation
============
Install ack (instructions: http://betterthangrep.com/ )
Run the following if you haven't already:
  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
Install the gem:
  sudo gem install Juice10-bogus_sass_checker

Example
=======
Navigate to your rails project root and run:
  checksass

The output you receive are CSS classes and ids that probably aren't used in your rails project.
