Bogus Sass Checker
===============

This is a little ruby script that checks your rails project's Sass files for #ids and .classes and checks if you are using them in the rest of your rails project.
ack needs to be installed first (http://petdance.com/ack/)

Example
=======
Navigate to your rails project root and run:
  checksass

The output you receive are CSS classes and ids that probably aren't used in your rails project.
